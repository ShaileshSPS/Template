				<p class="text-white font-roboto-regular text-left mt-4">HappLabs was founded in 2016 by Nithin A.G. when a major insurance company (name withheld because confidentiality for us is a priority!) came to him with a business problem that previous vendors failed to solve after nearly two years of engagement.</p>
				<p class="text-white font-roboto-regular text-left">At this point, the insurance giant already wasted significant time and money on the project. With a promise of high-quality and quick turnaround, the newly-formed HappLabs delivered the project in under six months. HappLabs continues to service this client’s custom development needs as their “in-house” IT services team (one of our specialties!).</p>
				<p class="text-white font-roboto-regular text-left">Since that first successful project, HappLabs has grown to over 40 full-time employees in our Bangalore headquarters and recently opened our first office in Midtown Manhattan. Our broad technical expertise enables us to meet the demanding needs of legacy industries ranging from insurance to media technology to financial services.</p>
